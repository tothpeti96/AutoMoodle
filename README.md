# AutoMoodle
The Python script enables one to make an online test sheet with preprogrammed data sets. The program alleviates the tedious work of inputing all the test data to the Moodle online GUI so instead the program reads the test data from an adequatly formed Excel sheet and makes an xml file from it which later can be imported to the Moodle questions.
